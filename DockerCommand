Docker Command:-
Way to crate images on Docker:-
i) Take image from dockerhub
ii) Create a image from dockerfile
iii) Create a image from existing container

i) Take image from dockerhub:-
To pull/download image from dockerhub command is:-docker pull ubuntu(image name)
To install/run image command :- docker run ubuntu(image name)
There is also a different way to create and start  container:-
docker run -it --name container1(name of container) ubuntu(name of image) /bin/bash/
 
ii)Create a image from docker file:-
We need to create file with name Dockerfile:- touch Dockerfile
We need to edit this file with nano/vi (any editor) :- touch Dockerfile
We need to now add base image which we required to run :- FROM ubuntu(name of image)
We need to save the file and exit from file 
Now we need to build the image with command :- docker build -t myimage(name of new image) .
Now we can check , our images is created or not :- docker images

iii) Create a image from existing container
We need to need to open exiting container for that we first need to start container if it is in stop condition :- docker start container(name of the container )
Now after start we need to attach(go inside) into container :- docker attach container (container name)
Now make any change if require and exit the container
Now use commit command to make images of it:- docker commit container(existing container name ) myimage (new image name)
These are the serveral steps which required to create image in docker
